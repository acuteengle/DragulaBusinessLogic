# DragulaBusinessLogic

Uses Dragula JS (https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/) to create buckets and cards that you can drop into various buckets.

There is also a business logic portion where you are only allowed to add certain cards to certain buckets and if it's incorrect, it will color the card differently or not allow you to move it.
